Welcome to Group 1's Final Project Repository for BIS15L!


In this repository there are 4 main folders. Each member of Group 1 has a folder where their individual code is stored. The Cancer Type Overview is the folder which contains all of Anthony's code for the project and respective data sets. The Breast Cancer Analysis contains all of Jiaying's code and data files. The Oncoene Mutations folder contains all of Omar's code and data sets. Finally, included in this repository is a folder called BIS15L Final Project which combines all our work together into one file. Please feel free to look over our individual codes as well as our combined work in the Final Project file! 

In this project, we employed a three-pronged approach to analyzing the complexities of cancer. First, we started off with a broad overview of the disease through analysis on publically availabble clinical data from United Kingdom hospitals (https://www.cancerdata.nhs.uk/getdataout/data).
